AstroSage Call Center Optimization Project

With a 1 crore investment, the goal was to boost customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and profitability.

Key Takeaways: 81% Retention among 28,000+ users, but first-time user satisfaction needs improvement. Only 56.41% of calls are completed daily, indicating capacity challenges. 72.5% of users report dissatisfaction, highlighting an urgent need for service improvement. 78% of net income is from call services, making it a crucial revenue stream.
