AstroSage Call Center Optimization Project

Overview:
This project aimed to enhance customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and profitability of AstroSage's call center services with a 1 crore investment. The analysis revealed key areas for improvement, including first-time user satisfaction, capacity challenges, and technical upgrades.

Key Findings:
Retention Rate: 81% retention among 28,000+ users indicates a loyal customer base.
Call Completion Rate: Only 56.41% of calls are completed daily, highlighting capacity challenges.
User Dissatisfaction: 72.5% of users report dissatisfaction, emphasizing the need for service improvement.
Revenue Stream: 78% of net income is from call services, making it a crucial revenue stream.
Traffic Patterns: Traffic peaks at 8 AM, while off-peak times have fewer agents available, creating a mismatch in demand and staffing.

Recommended Actions:
To address these challenges, we propose the following actions:

Workforce Expansion (30 lakhs)
Hire more skilled agents and freelancers to manage peak traffic and reduce call wait times.

Agent Training Programs (20 lakhs)
Invest in training for call handling, time management, and customer service to improve user satisfaction.

Technology Upgrades for "Gurucool" Platform (25 lakhs)
Improve platform stability and user experience on chat services.

Shift Optimization (10 lakhs)
Align staffing with peak call times to reduce drop-off rates.

Performance Incentives & Feedback System (15 lakhs)
Introduce incentives for high-performing agents and establish a regular feedback loop for continuous service improvement.

Tools Used
MS Excel: Utilized Power Query, Pivot, Data Visualization, Dashboard, Aggregating Functions, lookup functions, and Presentation to drive operational decisions.
